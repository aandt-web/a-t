## 🌍 Introduction

Lingua Flow is a simple but powerful system that transforms documents and audio into accessible formats.  
It was designed to help students, researchers, and everyday users quickly:

- Extract text from **PDFs**
- Translate that text into multiple languages
- Convert text into **natural speech**
- Process audio files and generate translations

This project is open-source and built to be extended by the community.

## 🏗 How It Works

1. User uploads **PDF** or **Audio** file.  
2. System extracts **text** (via OCR or speech recognition).  
3. Text is passed into **translation module**.  
4. User selects target language.  
5. Text is converted into **speech** and output as `.mp3`.  
6. User downloads results.
